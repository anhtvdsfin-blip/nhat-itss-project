# JT-Helper (React + Vite)

Commands:
- npm install
- npm run dev      # start dev server
- npm run build    # build production

Notes:
- Speech recognition uses the browser Web Speech API (Chrome recommended).
- Options panel currently uses placeholder logic; replace with server/API calls for real analysis/translation.
